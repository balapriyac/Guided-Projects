# Learning Path to ML
 
I am a Machine learning enthusiast trying to learn and explore different applications of Machine Learning while constantly working on reinforcing my understanding of the math behind Machine Learning algorithms and Deep learning architectures. This repo contains some of projects that augment learning and understanding in Data Analysis,Machine Learning,DL applications in Image Processing,Natural Language Processing and related areas.

# Description

# Image Processing
**Image Compression and Generation using Variational Autoencoders**

**Using Autoencoders in Image Processing Applications**


# Natural Language Processing

# Language Classification
**Using Naive Bayes for Language Classification**
   - Model Used: MultiNomial Naive Bayes Classifier
   - Using the subwords perspective to improve performance.
   - Reference: [Neural Machine Translation of Rare Words with Subword Units](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.07909)
   - Code and data can be found [here](https://github.com/balapriyac/My-Learning-Path-to-Exploring-ML/tree/master/Language%20Classification%20using%20Naive%20Bayes)

# Sentiment Analysis
**Toxic Comment Classification Challenge(kaggle)**
  - [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge)
  - Model Used: GloVe for word embedding and Conv1D for feature extraction
  - Reference:[GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation](https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/glove.pdf)
 
**Binary Classification on Movie Reviews**
  - Dataset:[IMDB movie reviews dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment)
  - Model Used: Logistic Regression with BoW and TF-IDF for word embedding
  - Relevant reading: [Learning Word Vectors for Sentiment Analysis](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/papers/wvSent_acl2011.pdf)
  - [Introductory blog](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/02/quick-introduction-bag-of-words-bow-tf-idf/)
  
**Sentiment Analysis with BERT**

  
# Conversational AI 
**Building a simple chatbot using Rasa**
  - A simple chatbot using Rasa NLU (an open source library for conversational AI) to greet and answer queries on time zones.
  - [Useful reference](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/nlu/about/)
  
# Useful Case Studies that enhance understanding
**Case Study: NLP on NeurIPS papers to identify key research areas**
  - NLP on NeurIPS(Neural Information Processing Systems) papers to identify key research areas
  - Visualizing the exponential increase in the number of papers submitted to NeurIPS over the past 3 decades, Word cloud visualization and     Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify the important topics
