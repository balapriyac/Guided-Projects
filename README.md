# Learning Path to ML
 
This repo contains the code and data for some of projects that augment learning and understanding in Data Analysis,Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing and related areas.

# Description

**Natural Language Processing**

**Using Naive Bayes for Language Classification**
   - Model Used: MultiNomial Naive Bayes Classifier
   - Using the subwords perspective to improve performance.
   - Reference: [Neural Machine Translation of Rare Words with Subword Units](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.07909)
   
**Toxic Comment Classification Challenge(kaggle)**
  - [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge)
  - Model Used: GloVe for word embedding and Conv1D for feature extraction
  - Reference:[GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation](https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/glove.pdf)
 
**Binary Classification on Movie Reviews**
  - Dataset:[IMDB movie reviews dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment)
  - Model Used: Logistic Regression with BoW and TF-IDF for word embedding
  - Relevant reading: [Learning Word Vectors for Sentiment Analysis](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/papers/wvSent_acl2011.pdf)
  - [Introductory blog](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/02/quick-introduction-bag-of-words-bow-tf-idf/)
  
**Building a simple chatbot using Rasa**
  - A simple chatbot using Rasa NLU (an open source library for conversational AI) to greet and answer queries on time zones.
  - [Useful reference](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/nlu/about/)
  
**Case Study: NLP on NeurIPS papers to identify key research areas**
  - NLP on NeurIPS(Neural Information Processing Systems) papers to identify key research areas
  - Visualizing the exponential increase in the number of papers submitted to NeurIPS over the past 3 decades, Word cloud visualization and     Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify the important topics
