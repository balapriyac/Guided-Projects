# Description

**Natural Language Processing

-**Using Naive Bayes for Language Classification**
   - Model Used: MultiNomial Naive Bayes Classifier
   - Using the subwords perspective to improve performance.
   - Reference: [Neural Machine Translation of Rare Words with Subword Units](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.07909)
   
-**Toxic Comment Classification Challenge(kaggle)**
  - [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge)
